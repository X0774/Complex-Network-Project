For the downloads of the first three you will need to use the website "https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/", which contains a useful repository of astrophysical datasets.
You should then decide a sample length, that you can tweak using a parameter x, which can be decided a posteriori using the script "Misure di centralit√† al variare di x".
After the choice of a useful x from a physics point of view has been made you can then start the data analysis, examples are shown in the repository with the scripts given.

The scripts also contain a small code useful if you want to build the laplacian of the network you are considering.
